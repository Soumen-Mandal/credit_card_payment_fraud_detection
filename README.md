# credit_card_payment_fraud_detection

Abstract:
The purpose of this project is to detect the fraudulent
transactions made by credit cards by the use of machine
learning techniques, to stop fraudsters from the
unauthorized usage of customers’ accounts. The increase
of credit card fraud is growing rapidly worldwide, which is
the reason actions should be taken to stop fraudsters.
Putting a limit for those actions would have a positive
impact on the customers as their money would be
recovered and retrieved back into their accounts and they
won’t be charged for items or services that were not
purchased by them which is the main goal of the project.
Detection of the fraudulent transactions will be made by
using three machine learning techniques Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, XG-Boost, those models will
be used on a credit card transaction dataset.
